# Virtual Paint ðŸŽ¨

Imagine painting with your fingertips, as if on a virtual canvas. **Virtual Paint** is a revolutionary system that allows you to express yourself with breathtaking fluidity and freedomâ€”no stylus, no mess, just pure creative flow.

## Features

- **Hand Tracking**: Track your hand(s) and fingertips effortlessly in real time.
- **Drawing on Virtual Canvas**: Paint directly onto a virtual canvas using gestures.
- **Custom Colors and Thickness**: Choose colors and brush sizes dynamically.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Powered by OpenCV and Mediapipe for seamless performance.

## How It Works

This project uses a custom **Hand Tracking Library**, built on top of **OpenCV** and **Mediapipe**, to detect and track your hand movements. The fingertip positions are mapped to a virtual canvas, allowing you to draw with intuitive gestures.
